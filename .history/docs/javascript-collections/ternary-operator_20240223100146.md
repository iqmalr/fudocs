# Ternary Operations

In programming, "ternary" refers to the "ternary" operator, also known as the conditional operator. This operator provides a concise way to write conditional expressions. The general form of the "ternary" operator is:

```jsx title=".jsx"
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
```

This means that if the condition is `true`, the first expression (`expressionIfTrue`) will be evaluated; if the condition is `false`, the second expression (`expressionIfFalse`) will be evaluated.
