# Props

In React, `props` (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They allow you to customize and configure child components based on the needs of the parent component.

## Usage

Consider the following example where a `UserInfo` component is created to display user information. The `name` and `email` properties are passed to this component as props.

```jsx title="src/components/FuDocs.js"
function UserInfo(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>User Information</h2>
      <p>Name: {props.name}</p>
      <p>Email: {props.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  const user = {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>FuDocs</h1>
      <UserInfo name={user.name} email={user.email} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
