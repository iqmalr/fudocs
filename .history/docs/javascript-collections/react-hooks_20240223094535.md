# React Hooks

The `Count` component is a simple React functional component that implements a basic counter. It utilizes the useState hook to manage a state variable named hitung, representing the count. The component provides buttons for incrementing and decrementing the count, along with displaying the current count.

   <!-- ```jsx title=". jsx file"
   import React, { useState } from "react";

   const Counter = () => {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

     return (
       <div>
         <p>Count: {count}</p>
         <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default Counter;
   ``` -->

U can try this

    ```jsx live
    function Count() {
      // State variable 'count' and its updater function 'setCount'
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

      // Function to increment the count
      const Increment = () => {
        setCount(count + 1);
      };

      // Function to decrement the count, with a check to prevent negative values
      const Decrement = () => {
        if (count === 0) {
          setCount(0);
        } else {
          setCount(count - 1);
        }
      };

      // JSX rendering with the count value and buttons
      return (
        <>
          <div>
            <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
            <p>{count}</p>
            <button onClick={Increment}>+</button>
            <button onClick={Decrement}>-</button>
          </div>
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

- The useState hook initializes the state variable hitung with a default value of 0.
- The Increment function increments the `count` by 1.
- The Decrement function decrements the `count` by 1, but includes an if condition to prevent it from going below 0.
- The JSX in the return statement renders the current `count`, two buttons for incrementing and decrementing, and an informational message.

Interactivity
Clicking the "+" button increments the `count` by 1.
Clicking the "-" button decrements the `count` by 1, ensuring it doesn't go below 0.
Example
Here's how the `Count` component can be used in a React application:

```js title=".jsx"
import React from "react";
import Count from "./Count";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter App</h1>
      <Count />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Notes

This component serves as a simple example of state management with conditional decrementing in a functional React component. Feel free to customize it based on your application's needs.
